# WeatherForecastApp
This is a very simple HTML, CSS and Javascript based Weather Forecast App.
I have coded this project with the help of Stackoverflow and many more coding sites.

PLEASE REMEBER:

- If you really want to learn topics like Javascript, you should not just copy paste this project I would recommend you to just through typing it all out while seeing all the 
changes you have implemented on live server.

- If you just download the code and try to run it, it won't run. You would need to go to the script.js file and follow the instruction over there to start the web app properly.

- If you want you can also you different weather api's. The link of the api, I have provided in the script.js file just happens to be free thats why I used that, which is why it
might not be always correct.

- The images used in this weather app are all from https://www.pexels.com/ and are free
